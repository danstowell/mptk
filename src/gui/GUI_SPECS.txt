Specifications of the MPTK GUI
------------------------------

   ----------------
I) General synopsis
   ----------------
The purpose of the GUI is to gather the functionalities of mpd, mpf
and mpr under a graphical user interface.

The GUI will mainly act on:
- a book;
- a residual signal ("res");
- a mask to select atoms from the book.

It should be possible to derive the following data:
- a signal rebuilt from the book (called an approximant, "approx"),
  possibly with the addition of the residual;
- a masked book ("bookYes") and its complement ("bookNo");
- the signals corresponding to bookYes and bookNo, possibly with
  addition of the residual.

Possible actions are:
- displaying any signal as zoomable 2D curve;
- displaying any signal as a spectrogram;
- displaying the books as any of the following time-frequency representations:
  pseudo Wigner-Ville ("blobs") or atom supports and energy ("rectangles");
(- in any of the above, the time/frequency/energy axes should remain
  synchronized after a zooming operation, and a colormap should be definable
  and adjustable for the time-frequency views;)
- listening to the signals;
- perform Matching Pursuit on the residual in order to feed the book;
- define and apply a mask on the book to obtain bookYes and bookNo;
- select atoms by mouse clicks on the time-frequency plots;
[- manually edit the atoms from the book, partly through drag and drop actions.]
[- print or export the various vizualisations ?]

The following relations should hold:

a) book = approximant :
   it is possible to rebuild an approximant from a book.

b) book(n) + res(n) = book(n-1) + res(n-1) :
   At iteration n, it is possible to take atoms from the residual(n-1),
   append them to the book and obtain a new residual(n). This corresponds
   to executing one or several iterations of Matching Pursuit.

c) mask.apply(book) = bookYes;
   mask.apply_negative(book) = bookNo;
   book = bookYes + bookNo :
   it is possible to apply a mask to a book, to select certain atoms only
   (i.e., those with low frequency, or short time-span, or a combination
   of criteria).

d) bookYes = approxYes;
   bookNo = approxNo :
   similarly to a), it is possible to rebuild approximants from
   the corresponding books.

  - Save books...
    -> Saving dialogue with 3 file-name fields for book,
       bookYes ("masked book") and bookNo ("complement of masked book"); 
       any of these books is saved if the corresponding filename is given.

  - Save rebuilt signal
  - Save residual
