mptkMEX
-------
This toolbox is a MEX implementation of the matlab utilities included in MPTK. At this time, only the functions bookread and bookwrite are implemented. This toolbox has been tested with the version 0.5.2 of MPTK. The following blocks are supported: gabor, harmonic, mdct, mclt, dirac.

WARNING: MPTK must be installed !!
And matlab search path variable as to be set with the mptk lib directory:
for instance "C:\Program Files\MPTK\lib\release" for Windows OS,
or "usr/local/lib" for Linux OS like system

On all plateform, the utilities need an environment variable called MPTK_CONFIG_FILENAME to be set with the path 
of the path.xml file located in the bin directory.
This file defines the path to the Atoms/Block plugin location. On Windows system in the case you have installed MPTK library and utilities in an non standard directory
(eg different of "C:/Program Files/MPTK") you have to modify the path inside of this file with the real installation path.

In order to set an environment variable on Linux like os:
-with Bash shell:
export MPTK_CONFIG_FILENAME="path_to_MPTK/bin/path.xml"
-with C-shell:
setenv MPTK_CONFIG_FILENAME "path_to_MPTK/bin/path.xml"
You can check if the environment variable is correctly set with:
echo $MPTK_CONFIG_FILENAME
On Mac OSX an other solution is to edit ~/.MacOSX/environment.plist to add a key-value pair MPTK_CONFIG_FILENAME="/Users/your-username/.mptk/path.xml"
In order to set environment variable on Windows like system:
Lauch a command line and use the SET command:
SET MPTK_CONFIG_FILENAME=path_to_MPTK/bin/path.xml 
for example SET MPTK_CONFIG_FILENAME=C:/Program Files/MPTK/bin/path.xml 
To check if the environment variable is correctly set you can use the ECHO command:
ECHO %MPTK_CONFIG_FILENAME%
