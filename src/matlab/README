mptk4matlab
-------
This toolbox is a MEX implementation of the matlab utilities included in MPTK. 
The main MEX implementations include
-input output of the main MPTK data structures (books, dictionaries, signal), e.g. bookread, bookwrite
-decomposition and reconstruction (mpdecomp, mprecons)
-some experimental Matlab code to edit and display books made of time-frequency atoms
-this toolbox has been tested with the version 0.5.6 of MPTK. 

WARNING: MPTK must be installed !!

On all platforms, the utilities need an environment variable called MPTK_CONFIG_FILENAME to be set with the path 
of the path.xml file located in the bin directory.
This file defines the path to the Atoms/Block plugin location. On Windows system in the case you have installed MPTK library and utilities in an non standard directory
(eg different of "C:/Program Files/MPTK") you have to modify the path inside of this file with the real installation path.

In order to set an environment variable on Linux like os:
-with Bash shell:
export MPTK_CONFIG_FILENAME="path_to_MPTK/bin/path.xml"
-with C-shell:
setenv MPTK_CONFIG_FILENAME "path_to_MPTK/bin/path.xml"
You can check if the environment variable is correctly set with:
echo $MPTK_CONFIG_FILENAME
On Mac OSX an other solution is to edit ~/.MacOSX/environment.plist to add a key-value pair MPTK_CONFIG_FILENAME="/Users/your-username/.mptk/path.xml"
In order to set environment variable on Windows like system:
Lauch a command line and use the SET command:
SET MPTK_CONFIG_FILENAME=path_to_MPTK/bin/path.xml 
for example SET MPTK_CONFIG_FILENAME=C:/Program Files/MPTK/bin/path.xml 
To check if the environment variable is correctly set you can use the ECHO command:
ECHO %MPTK_CONFIG_FILENAME%


And matlab search path variable has to be set with the mptk bin directory:
for instance "C:\Program Files\MPTK\bin" for Windows OS,
alternatively the PATH environment variable may be set with "C:\Program Files\MPTK\bin"
Lauch a command line and use the SET command:
for example SET PATH=C:\Program Files\MPTK\bin 
To check if the environment variable is correctly set you can use the ECHO command:
ECHO %PATH%
