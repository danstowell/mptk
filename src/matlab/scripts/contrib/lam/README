Mat2MPTK
-------

This matlab toolkit make the MPTK commands available under Matlab. The main MPTK commands are available as functions, handling signals and Book structures, without manipulating .wav nor .bin files.

Correspondance between MPTK command lines and Mat2MPTK:
* -X<value> corresponds to the pair ...,'X', <value>,...
* --option <value> corresponds to the pair ...,'option', <value>,...
* '-' in option names must be replaced by '_'


Special features:
----------------
* the file ~/.mptk/MPTKconfig.txt contains the default options for the MPTK commands. Example: if you write 'v = 1', all the MPTK commands will be called with the '-v' option (verbose), unless you specify the pair ,'v',0, in the function
* to simplify function callings, the dictionary files are stored in a specific directory (by default, the 'Dict' subdirectory of the toolbox.
* the 'GenerDict' function has been implemented to generate standard dictionary files, and the returns the name of the file. WARNING: GenerDict is currently not maintained and may not remain compatible with evolving versions of MPTK. Please prefer the dictcreate_gui.m graphical interface to create dictionaries when possible.

Remarks:
-------
* mp*_wrap functions allow to call MPTK commands by using files instead of signals or Book structures. They are used by the mp* functions, but they are not very conveninent for standalone use. 

Implemented commands:
mpd, mpr, mpf, mpcat, mpd_demix

Demo: (also in the Mat2MPTKdemo.m file)
----
load handel;
[B, res, dec]=mpd(y, Fs, 'n', 1000);%will run mpd with the 'default.xml' dictionary file.
figure;plot(10*log(dec)); title('Decay');xlabel('iterations');ylabel('Energy [dB]');
[B1, B2] = mpf(B, 'i', '[1:500]');%split the book into two books, B1 contains the 500 first atoms, B2 the 500 following ones
figure;bookplot(B1);
figure;bookplot(B2);

y1 = mpr(B1); %build signal from B1
y2 = mpr(B2, res); % build signal from B2 and add the initial residual
B3 = mpcat(B1, B2); % B3 must be equal to B!

Note:
----
WARNING: MPTK must be installed !!
And matlab search path variable as to be set with the mptk lib directory 

On all plateform, the utilities need an environment variable called MPTK_CONFIG_FILENAME to be set with the path 
of the path.xml file located in the bin directory.
This file defines the path to the Atoms/Block plugin location. On Windows system in the case you have installed MPTK library and utilities in an non standard directory
(eg different of "C:/Program Files/MPTK-0.5.4") you have to modify the path inside of this file with the real installation path.

In order to set an environment variable on Linux like os:
-with Bash shell:
export MPTK_CONFIG_FILENAME="path_to_MPTK/bin/path.xml"
-with C-shell:
setenv MPTK_CONFIG_FILENAME "path_to_MPTK/bin/path.xml"
You can check if the environment variable is correctly set with:
echo $MPTK_CONFIG_FILENAME
On Mac OSX an other solution is to edit ~/.MacOSX/environment.plist to add a key-value pair MPTK_CONFIG_FILENAME="/Users/your-username/.mptk/path.xml"
In order to set environment variable on Windows like system:
Lauch a command line and use the SET command:
SET MPTK_CONFIG_FILENAME=path_to_MPTK/bin/path.xml 
for example SET MPTK_CONFIG_FILENAME=C:/Program Files/MPTK-0.5.4/bin/path.xml 
To check if the environment variable is correctly set you can use the ECHO command:
ECHO %MPTK_CONFIG_FILENAME%

Windows OS like system may complain with a missing dll: MSVCR71D.DLL
You may install the files by using the Microsoft (TM) c runtime library SDK installer 
Or download it with this adress for example: http://www.dll-files.com/dllindex/dll-files.shtml?msvcr71d
