Mat2MPTK
-------

This matlab toolkit make the MPTK commands available under Matlab. The main MPTK commands are available as functions, handling signals and Book structures, without manipulating .wav nor .bin files.

Correspondance between MPTK command lines and Mat2MPTK:
* -X<value> corresponds to the pair ...,'X', <value>,...
* --option <value> corresponds to the pair ...,'option', <value>,...
* '-' in option names must be replaced by '_'


Special features:
----------------
* the file ~/.mptk/MPTKconfig.txt contains the default options for the MPTK commands. Example: if you write 'v = 1', all the MPTK commands will be called with the '-v' option (verbose), unless you specify the pair ,'v',0, in the function
* to simplify function callings, the dictionary files are stored in a specific directory (by default, the 'Dict' subdirectory of the toolbox.
* the 'GenerDict' function has been implemented to generate standard dictionary files, and the returns the name of the file.

Remarks:
-------
* mp*_wrap functions allow to call MPTK commands by using files instead of signals or Book structures. They are used by the mp* functions, but they are not very conveninent for standalone use. 

Implemented commands:
mpd, mpr, mpf, mpcat, mpd_demix

Demo: (also in the Mat2MPTKdemo.m file)
----
WARNING: MPTK binaries must be installed !!

load handel;
[B, res, dec]=mpd(y, Fs, 'n', 1000);%will run mpd with the 'default.xml' dictionary file.
figure;plot(10*log(dec)); title('Decay');xlabel('iterations');ylabel('Energy [dB]');
[B1, B2] = mpf(B, 'i', '[1:500]');%split the book into two books, B1 contains the 500 first atoms, B2 the 500 following ones
figure;bookplot(B1);
figure;bookplot(B2);

y1 = mpr(B1); %build signal from B1
y2 = mpr(B2, res); % build signal from B2 and add the initial residual
B3 = mpcat(B1, B2); % B3 must be equal to B!

Note:
----
bookread, bookwrite and bookplot are parts of the MPTK Toolkit. They can also be found in the 'extras/matlab' subdirectory of MPTK package.
