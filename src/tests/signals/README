Test signals:
- metiss.{wav,pcm,flt} : the metiss logo sound in various formats
                         (.flt means float numbers)

- 2_atoms.flt : the 2 following gabor atoms @ 8000Hz:
                -> 256 samples of 100*cos( 2*pi*440*t ),
                   hamming windowed,
                   positioned from sample 257 to sample 512
                -> 128 samples of 50*cos( 2*pi*1000*t )
                   hamming windowed,
                   positioned from sample 2049 to sample 2176
                -> the rest is zeros, total length 8000 samples.

- 2_shifting_cosines.flt : 4000 samples of a mix of 2 cosine waves, then
                 4000 samples of another mix of 2 cosines. (The spectrogram
                 should show 2 parallel lines, then a shift of those
                 lines.)

- 2_cosines.flt : 8000 samples of a mix of 2 cosines (spectrum should have
                  2 noticeable peaks).
