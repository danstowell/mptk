* Typographic conventions:
    - myVar,
    - mp_my_function,
    - MP_MY_CONST,
    - MP_My_Type_t
    - MP_My_Class_c

* Generic library header:
  All the .h are concatenated in a generic mptk.h at build time.
  Do not #include the individual headers, but #include "mptk.h" instead.
  (See the CMakeLists.txt, and update it if you create a new .h header file.)

* System dependent includes:
  Any system-dependent include (e.g., stdio.h, strings.h etc.)
  should be included via the mp_system.h located at the top
  of the source tree (together with configure.in etc.).
  Do not #include system headers in your .cpp sources,
  #include "mp_system.h" instead.
