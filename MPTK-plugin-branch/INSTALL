1.Getting started
 1.1.Required tools
	Cmake : at least version 2.4 
	gcc :  tested on version at least 4.1.1  
 1.2.Required packages
	Libsndfile: at least version 1.0.11 
	fftw: at least version 3.0.1 
	mptk: at least version 0.5.3
	
 2.Basic build
Suppose you untar MPTK-0.5.3.tar.gz in directory ~/foo
and you wantto build MPTK binary and library files in ~/bar.
The Command list you should use will look like this:
bash-3.1$ mkdir ~/bar
bash-3.1$ cd ~/bar
bash-3.1$ cmake ~/foo
bash-3.1$ make
bash-3.1$ make install 

When using the cmake command to generate the build system, Cmake performs a
list of tests to determine the system configuration and manage the build system.
If the configuration is correct then the build system is generated and written.
In this case the three last lines of the console log of cmake command should be:

-- Check for working C compiler: gcc
-- Check for working C compiler: gcc works
...
-- Configuring done
-- Generating done
-- Build files have been written to: ~/bar

 3.Basic install 
make install will install in default directory /usr/local

 4.Custom build and install 
If you want to change build and/or install options (for example to install MPTK in a
different folder or to enable the parallel computing using multithread capacities provided by the OS).
In order to build the MPTK library and executable files, you have to generate a build system with Cmake.
This build system can be parametrized using the Cmake Graphical User Interface,
which is also used to fix possible issues of the build system configuration.
This will yield the following sequence of commands:

bash-3.1$ mkdir ~/bar
bash-3.1$ cd ~/bar
bash-3.1$ cmake ~/foo
bash-3.1$ ccmake /.

[Using the Cmake GUI to configure build system options]

bash-3.1$ make
bash-3.1$ make install
