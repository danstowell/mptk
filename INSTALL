
* If you obtained Matching Pursuit as an archive, and you have fftw3 and libsndfile
  installed in specific directories, such as $FFTW3_DIR and $LIBSNDFILE_DIR :

    gtar zxvf mptk-?.?.tar.gz
    cd mptk-?.?/
    ./configure --with-fftw3=$FFTW3-DIR --with-libsndfile=$LIBSNDFILE_DIR
    make
    make install


* If you obtained Matching Pursuit as an archive, and you have fftw3 and libsndfile
  installed on your system:

    gtar zxvf mptk-?.?.tar.gz
    cd mptk-?.?/
    ./configure
    make
    make install


* If you want to install in a non-system location, such as directory $MYDIR
  instead of /usr/local, add --prefix=$MYDIR (e.g., --prefix=$HOME/local)
  to the configure switches.


* If you obtained Matching Pursuit from a CVS checkout :

    cvs checkout mptk
    cd mptk
    ./make_configure.sh
    ./configure  --with-fftw3=$FFTW3-DIR --with-libsndfile=$LIBSNDFILE_DIR
    make

* By default, everything is linked as non-static. If you don't want to mess up
  with LD_LIBRARY_PATH and want to have everything statically linked in libmp.a,
  add --enable-static to the configure switches.


Enjoy !
