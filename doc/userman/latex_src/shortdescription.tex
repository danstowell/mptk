The Matching Pursuit Toolkit provides a fast implementation of the Matching
Pursuit algorithm for the sparse decomposition of signals.

With this algorithm, a signal can be decomposed into a sparse set of
structured time-frequency features called {\em atoms}. A given set of atoms can
be pruned or modified, and the corresponding signal can be rebuilt. 
This algorithm can find applications in audio (sound analysis, blind source separation,
sound transformation and low bit rate coding).

In MPTK, a base library provides a set of routines to allow the
users to interface the algorithm with their own applications. Then, a set of
standalone routines is provided for the users to decompose, modify and rebuild
their signals straight from the command line. Finally, a set of scripts is
provided to facilitate the visualization of the results under Matlab and Python.
