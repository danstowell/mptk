\noindent This document aims at describing the basic principles of the Matching
Pursuit Tool Kit, and some basic guidelines about how to use it.  The appendix
also provides the potential contributor with notes about the insides of our
implementation, plus guidelines about some of the development conventions that
we have adopted. For a more detailed documentation of the code, see the
automatically generated reference manual.

\section{General principles \label{gen}}
%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Terminology \label{term}}
%%
\paragraph{Atom --} An elementary piece of signal. An atom is characterized by
its class (e.g., Gabor atoms, harmonic atoms etc.) and a set of parameters
(e.g., for a Gabor atom, its time location and length, its frequency, its
amplitude, a chirp factor and a given shaping window). In our code, the
corresponding object knows how to subtract itself from a signal, and how to
generate its own waveform.

\paragraph{Block --} A block operates a time-frequency transform
along the whole support of a signal. The time-frequency transform could be of
any type (STFT, wavelets etc.) provided it can be interpreted as a set of
correlations between the signal and a set of atoms which cover the
time-frequency plane. For the moment, only Gabor blocks and Harmonic blocks are
implemented, based on Short-Term Fourier Transforms\footnote{Dirac blocks are
  also available. They provide no particular time-frequency transform, they
  just find signal sample with a high energy.}. In this case, one block equals
one STFT with a given scale.

Several blocks corresponding to various scales or various transforms can be
concurrently applied to the same signal, thus providing for multi-scale or
multiple-basis analysis.

Each block object can search for the location of the maximum correlation
between the atoms and the signal, and can thus deduce which atom contributes
the most energy to the analyzed signal.

\paragraph{Dictionary --} A dictionary contains a collection of blocks plus
the signal on which they operate. It can search across all the blocks (i.e.,
all the scales and all the bases) for the atom which brings the most energy to
the analyzed signal.

\paragraph{Book --} A book is a collection of atoms. Summing all the atoms in
a book gives a signal.

\caption{\label{mpcycle}Our implementation of Matching Pursuit. \newline
  (See sections~\ref{term} and~\ref{algo} for a detailed explanation.)}
\end{figure}
%
Figure~\ref{mpcycle} illustrates the fact that a dictionary contains a signal
and a collection of blocks, and that a books contains a collection of atoms.
The algorithm linking these objects will be explained in the next section.


%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Algorithm \label{algo}}
%%
Our implementation of the Matching Pursuit algorithm uses roughly 3 steps, as
illustrated in figure~\ref{mpcycle}:
\begin{enumerate}
\item update the correlations in the blocks, by applying the relevant
  time-frequency transforms to the analyzed signal, and find the maximum
  correlation in the same loop;
\item create the atom which corresponds to the maximum correlation with the
  signal (and store this atom in the book);
\item subtract the created atom from the analyzed signal, thus obtaining a
  residual signal, and re-iterate the analysis on this residual.
\end{enumerate}
At each step, the original signal can be rebuilt exactly by summing all the
atoms of the book and adding them to the residual signal.

\section{User manual for the standalone utilities \label{man}}
%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Introduction}

The Matching Pursuit standalone utilities are designed so that a typical
processing task decomposes into a chain of commands which can be connected by
pipes. The signal decomposition is performed by {\tt mpd}. The atoms stored in
the resulting books can be filtered (i.e., sorted and selected) with the
command {\tt mpf}. Several books can then be concatenated with the command {\tt
  mpcat}. Once a desired book is obtained, a corresponding approximant signal
can be rebuilt using {\tt mpr}, with the optional addition of a residual signal
(or in addition to any other signal). Alternately, the {\tt mpd\_demix} utility
provides blind source separation using Matching Pursuit when the mixing matrix
is known. Each of the cited utilities have a {\tt -h} switch to get
command-line help.

\bigskip

\noindent Some typical processing chains include:
\begin{itemize}
\item Signal approximation with N atoms: \\
      \mbox{\tt mpd -D dictionary -n N soundFile.wav book.bin;} \\
      \mbox{\tt mpr book.bin approx.wav} \\
      -- or -- \\
      \mbox{\tt mpd -D dictionary -n N soundFile.wav - | mpr - approx.wav}
\item Exact reconstruction: \\
      \mbox{\tt mpd -D dictionary -n N soundFile.wav book.bin residual.wav;} \\
      \mbox{\tt mpr book.bin approx.wav residual.wav}
\item Signal approximation, using only the short atoms (e.g., of less than
128~samples) \linebreak and ignoring the residual: \\
      \mbox{\tt mpd -D dictionary -n N soundFile.wav book.bin;} \\
      \mbox{\tt mpf --length=[0:128] book.bin bookShort.bin;} \\
      \mbox{\tt mpr bookShort.bin approx.wav}
\item Blind source separation and rebuilding an approximation of one of the
  sources (e.g., the~3rd one): \\
      \mbox{\tt mpd\_demix -D dictionary -M matrix.txt -n N mix.wav bookFile;} \\
      \mbox{\tt mpr bookFile\_3.bin approxOfSource3.wav}
\end{itemize}
Lots of other combinations are possible. The relevant utilities are described
with more detail in the next sections.

\subsection{mpd: signal decomposition}

\subsubsection*{Usage:}
\begin{verbatim}
mpd [options] -D dictFILE.txt (-n N|-s SNR) (sndFILE.wav|-) (bookFILE.bin|-) ...
              ... [residualFILE.wav]
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection*{Synopsis:}
Iterates Matching Pursuit on signal sndFILE.wav with dictionary dictFile.txt
and gives the resulting book bookFILE.bin (and an optional residual signal)
after N iterations or after reaching the signal-to-residual ratio SNR.  See
section~\ref{dict_format} for a description of the syntax of the dictionary
files.


\subsubsection*{Mandatory arguments:}
\begin{verbatim}
     -D<FILE>, --dictionary=<FILE>  Read the dictionary from text file FILE.

     -n<N>, --num-iter=<N>|--num-atoms=<N>    Stop after N iterations.

                                              is reached. If both options are
                                              used together, the algorithm stops
                                              as soon as either one is reached.

     (sndFILE.wav|-)                          The signal to analyze or stdin
                                              (in WAV format).
     (bookFILE.bin|-)                         The file to store the resulting
                                              book of atoms, or stdout.
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection*{Optional arguments:}
\begin{verbatim}
     -E<FILE>, --energy-decay=<FILE>  Save the energy decay as doubles
                                      to file FILE.
     -R<N>,    --report-hit=<N>       Report some progress info (in stderr)
                                      every N iterations.
     -S<N>,    --save-hit=<N>         Save the output files every N iterations.
     -T<N>,    --snr-hit=<N>          Test the SNR every N iterations only
                                      (instead of each iteration).

     residualFILE.wav                The residual signal after subtraction
                                     of the atoms.

     -q, --quiet                    No text output.
     -v, --verbose                  Verbose.
     -V, --version                  Output the version and exit.
     -h, --help                     This help.

\subsection{Format of the dictionary files \label{dict_format}}
%%%%%%%%%
The dictionary files use a syntax ``\`a la XML'', with tags enclosed between
angle brackets. Strict XML compliance is not mandatory, it is just provided as
a convenience for interested users or for easy checking of the dictionary's
syntax\footnote{Uh, that is, when the DTD is ready.}.

\subsubsection*{General rules}
A dictionary should include, in the following order:
\begin{enumerate}
\item an optional XML declaration line;
\item an optional library version tag;
\item a mandatory dictionary opening tag;
\item a list of blocks with their parameters (some parameters being mandatory,
  some admitting default values);
\item a dictionary closing tag.
\end{enumerate}
Any text included after the dictionary closing tag will be ignored. Blank
spaces and line breaks are ignored. Any part of the file can be commented out
either by enclosing it between \verb+<!--+ and \verb+-->+ (XML style), or by
adding a '\verb+#+' at the beginning of the commented lines (shell style, NOT
XML compliant). The parser will send any text it can't match to stderr.
Therefore, in the event of syntax errors, spurious text output will show up in
stderr.


\subsubsection*{Valid tags}
\begin{itemize}

\item \verb+<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>+ [optional]: the XML
  declaration line. It is ignored by the parser.
  
\item \verb+<libVersion>+blah\verb+</libVersion>+ [optional]: the library
  version declaration. This is provided for backward compatibility if we ever
  change the dictionary syntax. When absent, the library version is taken to be
  the current one.

\item \verb+<dict>+List of blocks\verb+</dict>+: the opening and closing tags
  for the dictionary. Anything coming after the \verb+</dict>+ tag will be
  ignored by the parser.

\item \verb+<block type="VALID_TYPE">+List of block
  parameters\verb+</block>+: the opening and closing tags for a block.
  \verb+VALID_TYPE+ should be one of \verb+dirac+, \verb+gabor+ or
  \verb+harmonic+.
  
\item \verb+<par type="VALID_TYPE">+Value\verb+</par>+: a block parameter. The
  \verb+VALID_TYPE+, corresponding values types and relevant block types
  (G==gabor, H==harmonic) are given below:
  \begin{itemize}

  \item \verb+windowLen+ with an unsigned long int value (G,H): the atom length
    (i.e., the window length in the STFT).

  \item \verb+windowShift+ with an unsigned long int value (G,H): the atom
    shift (i.e., the window shift in the STFT).
    
  \item \verb+windowRate+ with a double value between 0.0 and 1.0 (G,H): an
    alternate way to specify the window shift, as a proportion of the
    windowLen.  If both are present, \verb+windowShift+ has precedence over
    \verb+windowRate+.
    
  \item \verb+fftSize+ with an unsigned long value (G,H): the frequency
    resolution in terms of FFT size. It has to be greater or equal to
    \verb+windowLen+ if \verb+windowLen+ is even, or $\geq$\verb2(windowLen+1)2
    if \verb+windowLen+ is odd. If absent, defaults to \verb+windowLen+ (or
    \verb2windowLen+12).
    
  \item \verb+f0Min+ with a double value (H): minimum frequency (in Hz) from
    which the fundamental frequency of the harmonic atoms is searched. Defaults
    to the first non-null FFT frequency.
    
  \item \verb+f0Max+ with a double value (H): maximum frequency (in Hz) at
    which the fundamental frequency of the harmonic atoms is searched.
    Defaults to the Nyquist frequency of the considered signal.
    
  \item \verb+numPartials+ with an unsigned int value (H): number of partials
    considered when tracking the harmonic atoms.

  \end{itemize}
  Note that the \verb+dirac+ blocks don't need any parameter (they just match
  signal samples).
 
\item \verb+<window type="VALID_WINDOW_TYPE" opt="OPTIONAL_VALUE"></window>+: a
  window specification to be included among the block parameters.
  
  The following \verb+VALID_WINDOW_TYPE+s do not require the \verb+opt=""+
  attribute: \\ \verb+rectangle+, \verb+triangle+, \verb+cosine+, \verb+hanning+,
  \verb+hamming+, \verb+blackman+, \verb+flattop+, \verb+fof+.
  
  The following \verb+VALID_WINDOW_TYPE+s do require the \verb+opt=""+
  attribute: \\ \verb+hamgen+, \verb+gauss+, \verb+exponential+. \\
  The meaning of the optional parameter varies according to the window type.
  See the reference manual for more info.
  
  For the moment, nothing is needed between the opening and closing
  \verb+<window>+ tags, and the \verb+</window>+ tag can be safely omitted
  unless you want to be strictly XML compliant. This may change in future
  versions (we reserve the \verb+</window>+ tag for the case of specifying
  arbitrary windows, unimplemented yet).

\end{itemize}


\subsubsection*{Global variables}

The block parameters can be made global using some \verb+<glob>+ tags having
the same syntax as the \verb+<par>+ tags. For example, \verb+<glob type="windowLen">32</glob>+
creates a global \verb+windowLen+ value of 32. In
the blocks following the declaration of a global value, any parameter
corresponding to a preset global value can be omitted and will be automatically
replaced by the relevant global value. In our example, any block following the
global definition of \verb+windowLen+, and which doesn't have a local
\verb+<par type="windowLen">xxx</par>+ definition, will have its \verb+windowLen+ parameter
set to 32.

Similarly, a window can be made global using \verb+<glob window type="...">+
instead of \linebreak \verb+<window type="...">+.

The scope of a global value starts after its declaration. Global values can't
be un-globalized. A new setting of a particular \verb+glob+ will overwrite its
former value. Local \verb+<par>+ or \verb+<window>+ declarations have
precedence over the global values.

\subsection{mpf: filtering of the book files}

\subsubsection*{Usage:}
\begin{verbatim}
     mpf --PROPERTY1=[min:max] ... --PROPERTY_N=[min:max] (bookIn.bin|-) ...
         [bookYes.bin|-] [bookNo.bin]
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection*{Synopsis:}
Filters the atoms contained in bookIn.bin (or stdin), stores those which
satisfy the indicated properties in bookYes.bin (or stdout) and the others in
bookNo.bin.

\subsubsection*{Mandatory arguments:}
\begin{verbatim}
  (bookIn.bin|-)      A book of input atoms, or stdin.
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection*{Optional arguments:}
\begin{verbatim}
  (bookYes.bin|-)     A file (or stdout) to store the book of atoms which
                      satisfy the indicates properties.
  bookNo.bin          A file to store a book of atoms which do not satisfy
                      the indicated properties.
  If no output files are given, the atoms are just counted and their number
  is reported in stderr.

  One or more of the following switches:
  --index=[min:max]    / -i [min:max] : keep the atoms ordered from min to max
                                        in the book
  --length=[min:max]   / -l [min:max] : keep a specific range of atom lengths
                                        (in number of samples)
  --Length=[min:max]   / -L [min:max] : keep a specific range of atom lengths
                                        (in seconds)
  --position=[min:max] / -p [min:max] : keep a specific range of atom positions
                                        (in number of samples)
  --Position=[min:max] / -P [min:max] : keep a specific range of atom positions
                                        (in seconds)
  --freq=[min:max]     / -f [min:max] : keep a specific frequency range (in
                                        normalized values between 0 and 0.5)
  --Freq=[min:max]     / -F [min:max] : keep a specific frequency range (in Hz)
  --amp=[min:max]      / -a [min:max] : keep a specific range of amplitudes
  --chirp=[min:max]    / -c [min:max] : keep a specific range of chirp factors

  The intervals can exclude the min or max value by using reverted braces,
  e.g. ]min:max] will exclude the min value.
  The intervals can be negated with prepending the '^' character,
  e.g. ^[min:max].

  The atom's type can be tested with:
  --type=gabor|harmonic|dirac / -t gabor|harmonic|dirac

 Other optional arguments are:

  -q, --quiet          No text output.
  -v, --verbose        Verbose.
  -V, --version        Output the version and exit.
  -h, --help           This help.
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection*{Example:}
Take all the atoms with a frequency lower than 50Hz and higher than 1000Hz
among the first 100 atoms of bookIn.bin, store them in bookYes.bin and store

\section{Extra utilities: visualization of MP books under Matlab \label{matlab}}
%%%%%%%%%

Some Matlab utilities are bundled with the distribution to help loading and
visualizing books under Matlab. They can be found in the ./extras/matlab/
directory of the source tree. They are not automatically installed by the
configure system: you should copy them manually to a location accessible to
your MATLABPATH.

\bigskip

\noindent The included files are:
\begin{itemize}
\item bookread.m: to load a binary book into Matlab;
\item bookplot.m: to plot a book in a spectrogram-like fashion;
\item bookover.m: to overlay a book plot on a STFT spectrogram.
\item dictread.m: under development. Don't use.
\end{itemize}
Each of these functions is equipped with some help info, e.g. to get help about
bookplot use:\\
\verb+    >> help bookplot+ \\

\section{Development tricks}
%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Interfacing and code factorization}
%%
To allow the dictionary to manage every class of blocks (i.e., every different
time-frequency transform) in the same way, every specific block class
inherits from a generic block class which implements some mandatory methods.
(Refer to the reference manual for details.)

Similarly, all the atoms inherit from a generic atom class, so that they can
perform a certain number of standard operations and so that they can be stored
in books.


%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Speed tricks}
%%
Our general philosophy is to avoid as much as possible to compute the same
operation twice.

For example, in the blocks, the update of the time-frequency transforms is
executed only along the part of the signal that were modified by subtracting an
atom at the previous step.

Similarly, the outcome of the time-frequency transforms is stored as a single
dimension vector. After each update of the time-frequency transforms, the
location of the maximum correlation can be anywhere along the vector. To avoid
browsing the whole length of it each time we perform a max correlation search,
we use a tree structure which keeps track of local maxima.

Finally, the signal processing windows are tabulated in a window server (called
by the blocks and the atoms) which has global scope over the whole code.

\section{Development conventions}
%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Typographic conventions}
Throughout the source code, the following typographic conventions are
preferably adopted:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf myVar} for variables;
\item {\bf my\_function} for functions;
\item {\bf MP\_MY\_CONST} for constants (\#define) and for global variables;
\item {\bf MP\_My\_Type\_t} for types;
\item {\bf MP\_My\_Class\_c} for classes.
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Memory allocation conventions}
The arrays are allocated using malloc (NOT new[]) and freed using free (NOT
delete[]). Conversely, the objects are created and deleted using new and
delete.

%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Source code locations}
From the source tree, the doc sources are stored in doc/, and the code sources
in src/. Then\,:
\begin{itemize}
\item the bulk of the Matching Pursuit library is stored in src/libmp/.
  Specifically, the implementation of blocks and atoms related to specific
  time-frequency transforms should be located in src/libmp/atom\_classes/. As a
  matter of fact, you should not have to modify other parts of the code when
  adding new classes of blocks and atoms. Think of it as a sort of plugin
  logic;
\item a standalone library (in C) to compute standard signal processing windows
  is stored in src/libdsp\_windows/;
\item the applications are stored in src/utils/;
\item a test suite is stored in src/tests/.
\end{itemize}
For the implementation of each class, we use one .h header file to declare the
class, plus a corresponding .cpp source with the same base name to implement
its methods. During a build, the .h headers are concatenated in one global
mptk.h header which should be the one included in all the individual .cpp
files.

A notable exception is the lexical scanner for the dictionary, which is written
in flex. A dict\_scanner.cpp source is automatically generated from the
dict\_scanner.lpp flex template. It has no corresponding .h header file.


%%%%%%%%%
\pagebreak
\subsection{Building and portability}
We use the automake/autoconf system to automatically adapt the building process
to your particular flavor of Unix. Therefore, every system call should be
performed through the ``system.h'' header files located at relevant places in
the source tree.

\paragraph{Known portability flaws --} The byte-order is not forced (yet) when
reading or writing binary data (mostly books and signals). Hence, books created
on a low-endian will crash on a big-endian and vice-versa. This will be
corrected in a future release.
